What happens when you visit a webpage?
The web works in ways not very mysterious, but rather, highly methodical.
When we visit a webpage, in essence, there is an exchange of information between two computers. The computer whose browser requests the information is called a client and the computer that responds to that request, a server. The client sends information regarding its system such as its browser type, operating system, and exactly what information it is looking for, which allows the server to know how to configure the information that it will be sending. The server then sends the requested information through a HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol, connection which is then received by the client in the form of a webpage. The way that information is presented to the client on the webpage is determined by HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language. The HTML that is transferred includes code called tags that indicates how the information should be formatted, where it should be place, whether it should be bolded, italicized, large or small, include graphics, etc. As numerous as the processes that occur when a webpage is visited may seem, all of this happens in such an incredibly short time which is what is so remarkable about the web today.
